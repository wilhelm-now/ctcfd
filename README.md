# CTCFD
This repository is an attempt at compile-time computational fluid dynamics. Its goal is to reach lid-driven cavity flow and follows the well known [12 steps to Navier-Stokes](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) project. It is implemented using types and typelists. GCC accepts it as C++98 code, Clang does not.
